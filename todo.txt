Sim:
- BB84 protocol, introduce errors manually(noise, losses...)
- Focus on QKD, generating secret key and put errors manually, 1%
- Reconciliation process
- Error correction/privacy amplification 
If we have time: Simulate where the Error bit rates.. come from!

Report: Min 3 pages, explaining what our code is doing and showing
simulation graphs. Code appended too.
